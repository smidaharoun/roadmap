MTCFSS Roadmap (events, workshops, challenges) using Kanban/Issues model.
All issues are managed on [this waffle board](https://waffle.io/smidaharoun/roadmap).

### Workflow:

- There are 4 type of tasks: _`Workshop/Training`_, _`Events`_, _`Challenges`_, _`Others`_
- Every task (card) is done on 4 steps:
  - **Backlog:** Idea is still not approved
  - **Ready:** Idea approved and waiting for someone to do it
  - **In progress:** Task is being worked on by someone (development, testing, admin,...)
  - **Done:** Task completed and well tested.
- Each Task has a _description_ and _comments_
- Task can be assigned to one or more persons
- Task can added to a GitHub _milestone_ to track progress and dependency
- Task can have many _labels_ (tags)

```
